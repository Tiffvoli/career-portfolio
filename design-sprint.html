        <h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
          This was my first design sprint that spanned over 5 days. We had to
          come up with an idea that would improve Fronter for all users
          (students, teachers and staffs). Our group decided on communication
          feature to connect everyone together in one platform. Our main goal
          was to create a direct message system between students and teachers
          therefore we could ask for feedback and help more efficiently. The
          platform also includes feed and social events to help students
          socialise with everyone better.
        </h3>
        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
          After design sprint, my task was to create a web prototype and made
          specifically for mobile.

                <h4>Day 1: Map</h4>
                For the first day, we drew a map that showcase our final
                solution and how we would get there. We also added notes around
                to figure out the problems and how we would solve them.

                <h4>Day 2: Sketch</h4>
                For the second day, we drew sketches for our Fronter app. Each
                of us would sketch our own platform and then after that we would
                line all of them together and chose the best one.

                <h4>Day 3: Decide | Storyboard</h4>
                After we decided on one sketch and everyone was happy. We drew a
                storyboard that would show a scenario from a student's
                perspective using the new Fronter app.

                <h4>Day 4: Prototype</h4>
                I wanted to do the prototype and my team trusted me with it. I
                followed the KEA design guide and inspiration from Facebook to
                design this. The prototype includes everything a student would
                need in KEA. It's a mobile version so students could use it with
                their phones.

                <h4>Day 5: Test</h4>
                We tested our prototype with several people from Erasmus
                programmes and the Danish line. They all liked our communication
                feature and thought it was useful to improve student's life.
                Some of them suggested to have a 'go back' function and comment
                feature therefore we added that in after.
