        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
          For this project, I was "hired" as the frontender for Hogwarts School
          of Witchcraft and Wizardry, to build a system to help the
          administrators handle student lists. As test-data you are given the
          students from the infamous class of 1991.
        </h3>
        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
          My tasks were to provide an interface to show the list, sort by
          firstname, lastname, or house, as well as filter by house. Some
          students can be appointed to join the inquisitorial squad. I was also
          tasked with implementing racial profiling, by adding "blood-status" to
          each student.
        </h3>
        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
          I could hack into the system by typing keystroke only known by me,
          this would allow me to insert myself into the student list. It would
          also mix up the insquistorial squad and blood statuses.

                <h4>Student Interface</h4>
                <h3>
                  The interface shows the students' fullname, house and options
                  to turn them into a prefect and/or an insquistorial squad
                  member. There is also an option to expel the student.

                <h4>Student Modal</h4>
                When the user clicks on a student, a pop-up would appear with
                the student's info with blood and student statuses. The colour
                would be the same as the student's house.

                </video>
                <h4>Sorting | Filtering</h4>
                There are options to filter the students into different houses.
                The user could also sort the students by lastname and firstname.
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>

                  <source src="video/prefect.mov" type="video/mp4" />

                <video width="90%" controls muted>
                  <source src="video/squad.mov" type="video/mp4" />
                </video>
                <h4>Insquistorial Squad | Prefect</h4>
                Anyone could become a member of the insquistorial squad, however
                only one person from each house could become a prefect and you
                could only have 2 prefects in total.
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>

                  <source src="video/expel.mov" type="video/mp4" />
                </video>
                <h4>Expel Students</h4>
                The expelled student would be removed from the active student
                list.
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>
                <img src="image/timeline1.5.jpg" alt="gallery" />
                <h4>Hacked System</h4>
                The hacking command would allow me to be inserted into the
                student list.
