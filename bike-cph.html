        <h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
          We were in charged of making a guide for the Copenhagen Bike Guide for
          tourists. The guide needed to include a instructional video and
          additional information about cycling in Copenhagen based on the I Bike
          CPH Brochure. The site had to follow the KBH's design guide provided
          by us by the client. I was tasked with the design department therefore
          I created the XD prototype and making the site itself while my
          teammates created the video.
        </h3>
        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
          This is the final website for our project.Both the aethetics for the
          website and video match really well together so it created a nice flow
          and unity. Overall, I think we met our goal of delivering a
          professional and informative guide for newcomers in Copenhagen.

                <img src="image/timeline8.1.jpg" alt="banner" />
                <h4>Banner | Menu</h4>
                I stuck with the same design as my prototype with the
                deconstructive style and KBH colour scheme. I chose to make the
                menu bar sticky so that it would follow the user wherever they
                scroll.

                <h4>Thumbnail</h4>
                We made small tutorial on the basic rules of biking and I
                desgined this thumbnail for the video. I used the same font and
                deconstructed style for the title. I chose white text and all
                caps so it could stand out from the colourful background of
                Nyboder.

                <img src="image/timeline8.3.jpg" alt="text" />
                <h4>Information</h4>
                Since the site was supposed to a guide, I wanted to make it
                informative so that the users would find everything on here
                without any confusion. I added the frise provided by KBH kommune
                in between the text so that it's easier to read.

            </li>

              <div>
                <img src="image/timeline8.4.jpg" alt="gallery" />
                <h4>Image Gallery</h4>
                This was the only new thing I added into the website since we
                thought it wouldn't make sense if we just put in the images.
                Therefore, I created a gallery with images corresponding to a
                few useful facts about biking in Copenhagen.

                <h4>Mobile Version</h4>
                >I made the website responsive to all devices using "vw" unit to
                make all the sizes stay relative to 1% of the width of the
                viewport. Therefore, the website can be resized while still
                maintaining its ratio.
