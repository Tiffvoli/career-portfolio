        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
          This was group project to create an artist portfolio for Isabel
          Berglund. Isabel encountered difficulties in establishing and
          maintaining an online presence and effective digital communication
          strategy in order to promote her art to buyers and other stakeholders.
        </h3>
        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
          Our goal was to research and re-design the artist’s existing solution
          with the aim of improving UI/UX. The re-design would entail an
          optimized and tested information architecture, grouping content in a
          way that makes sense to her target audience, as well as a strengthened
          visual identity. Furthermore, our new solution should enable the
          artist to make updates herself in a Wordpress backend in order for her
          to always feature her latest content.
        </h3>
        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
          Our group would also create content for her social media channels as
          well as develop a content strategy for the artist in order for her to
          better communicate and engage with her audience.

                <h4>Artist Profile</h4>
                Isabel Berglund, an established knit installation artist from
                Copenhagen. Her art pieces sometimes can take up to six months
                to create. In addition to creating art, she leads various art
                projects such as her “Social Art Projects”.

                  alt="style tile and moodboard"
                />
                <h4>Style Tile | Moodboard</h4>
                Isabel wanted a very simple, clean design similar to her
                existing website; white background with black typography. We
                tried to incorporate this into our prototype design, only adding
                a discreet red accent color as a highlight.

                  />
                </video>
                <h4>Video</h4>
                We created a short introductory video to promote the artist on
                her social media, specifically Instagram. We focused on her
                Social Projects because Isabel wanted an emphasis on that.

                <h4>CMS | API</h4>
                We stored all of Isabel artworks and projects in a Wordpress API
                using Pods. After that, we fetched the data into the website
                using Json. Isabel would have access to the Wordpress account
                where she could input her future art pieces and the website
                would be updated automatically.
