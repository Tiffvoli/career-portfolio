        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
          For this animation project, I had to work within a group. Our task was
          to create an interactive poster and we chose Monty Python and the Holy
          Grail for our movie. We thought the movie was very unique and filled
          with satire humour so we would have a lot of materials to work with. I
          chose to handle the character designs and sprite animations because I
          was excited to work with Illustrator.
        </h3>
        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
          This is the first project that I got to use the practical skills that
          I learned from MMD Animation and I am happy with the result.

                <img src="image/timeline3.1.jpg" alt="styletile" />
                <h4>Moodboard | Styletile</h4>
                To prep ourselves with this project, we first watched the movie
                to refresh our memory. After that, we created the moodboard and
                styletile as a design guide for our poster. The moodboard
                included the characters and scenes we would want to put in.

                <img src="image/timeline3.2.jpg" alt="storyboard" />
                <h4>Storyboard</h4>
                We chose 4 most iconic scenes from the movie and proceeded to
                draw them out so we would know what to draw and where to put
                them. Our main story was having the knights travel through each
                scene.

              <div>
                <img src="image/timeline3.3.jpg" alt="drawings" />
                <h4>Character Designs</h4>
                I designed all of these characters based on the movie using
                Illustrator. I used Illustrator because it's vector therefore
                all of the images are scalable with the quality being intact. I
                also used these images for sprite (more info below).
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>
                <img src="image/timeline3.4.jpg" alt="backgrounds" />
                <h4>Background Designs</h4>
                The backgrounds were also designed in Illustrator. The colours
                are very satured and natural because most of the settings for
                the movie is outdoor. We tried not to match the colours from the
                foreground objects to the background so that everything could be
                seen.

                  src="video/final.swf"
                  style="width: 100%;"
                  alt="sprite"
                />
                <h4>Sprite Animation</h4>
                I learned how to draw sprite animation in the lesson using
                Illustrator and loved it right away. I spent a while watching
                this coconut scene several times to mimic the movements onto my
                sprite. This sprite is made from 5 frames with fast speed. I'm
                happy about how this turned out.
