        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
          I was introduced to animation in Illustrator, this was new to me and I
          really enjoyed it. I learned how to make frame by frame animation plus
          how to achieve a good frame rate. This hugely expanded my skillset in
          Illustator.
        </h3>
        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
          This project was to write a short story with character development and
          plot and to create a sprite animation based on it.

              <div>
                <img src="image/timeline2.4.jpg" alt="storyline" />
                <h4>Storyline</h4>
                First thing to do was to create a storyline for my animation. I
                decided to do a travl animation because it would allow to play
                with designs from different countries.

            </li>

              <div>
                <img src="image/timeline2.1.jpg" alt="sketches" />
                <h4>Sketches</h4>
                After that, I sketched out all my characters and backgrounds
                depending on my storyline. This gave me a visualisation of my
                animation before actually making it.
              </div>
            </li>

              <div>
                <img src="image/timeline2.8.jpg" alt="storyboard" />
                <h4>Storyboard</h4>
                I was introduced to making a storyboard to aid the process. The
                storyboard included each screen with interaction, sound and
                duration so I would know what to add in later on.
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>
                <img src="image/timeline2.2.jpg" alt="character designs" />
                <h4>Character Designs</h4>
                I designed all the characters based on my skecthes in
                Illustrator to create vector graphics.I chose to make the
                characters gray and black because I intended to make the
                backgrounds colourful therefore it wouldn't be too overwhelming.
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>
                <img src="image/timeline2.3.jpg" alt="stance" />
                <h4>Stances</h4>
                For each character, I also created 4 different views to make the
                characters more lively and interactive.
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>
                <img src="image/timeline2.5.jpg" alt="style tile" />
                <h4>Style Tile</h4>
                I chose pop characters for my style because they normally have a
                outline around the characters so they would stand out more from
                the background. I put in a few pop colours while also having a
                dark tone to create a nice contrast and improve visability.
              </div>
            </li>

              <div>
                <embed src="video/neko_animation_tokyo.swf" atl="sprite" />
                <h4>Sprite</h4>
                I designed this sprite animation in Illustrator by creating
                frame by frame. I ran into a small problem with coding but I
                learned out to do it on a later project
                <a href="interactive-poster.html" style="color: #59b6bb;"
                  >(interactive poster)</a
                >.

            </li>
            <li>
              <div>
                <img src="image/timeline2.7.jpg" alt="background" />
                <h4>Background Designs</h4>
                I designed all of the background using Illustrator and took
                inspiration from Tokyo, New York and Sydney. I wanted to make
                the backgrounds very colourful to capture its respective city's
                beauty. I didn't use any dark colours so that the main
                characters could stand out from the backdrops.
